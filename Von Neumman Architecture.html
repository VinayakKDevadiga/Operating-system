  Process:
  program which is in an execution:

  New: in the New state, the process is created and its information is prepared by the operating system. Then it moves to the Ready state.
  Ready state: where it is loaded into main memory and placed inside the ready queue waiting for CPU time. 
  Running: When the CPU scheduler picks the process, it moves into the Running state and starts executing its instructions. 
  waiting : If during execution the process needs input/output or some external resource, it goes into the Waiting state until that operation is completed. 
  Ready: After the required operation completes, the process returns to the Ready state. 
  Terminated: Finally, when the process finishes execution, it enters the Terminated state, where all resources are released and the process is removed from the system.
